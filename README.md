On the main page the user can see the Astronomy Picture of the Day. 
This app is based on Functional JavaScript using pure functions, Higher Order Functions, the Immutable JS Library. 

## Installation and usage

To get started:

```yarn install``` 

Next you'll need a NASA developer API key in order to access the API endpoints. To do that, go here: https://api.nasa.gov/. If you want to simply look around at what api endpoints NASA offers, you can use their provided DEMO_KEY to do this.

In your repo, you will see a .env-example file with a place for your API key. Rename or copy the file to one called `.env` and enter in your key. 

Run:

```yarn start``` 

and go to `http:localhost:3000`.
